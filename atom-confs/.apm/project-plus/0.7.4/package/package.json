Yet another project manager (for atom)? Atom contains a\nlot of piping to make project management awesome. It's missing those few bits\nthat expose that awesome to users. This is that package.\n\n - **No configuration** — atom was already keeping track of your projects\n\n - **No mess** (project files) — atom already knows about your projects and their needs (and is planning to know more)\n\n - **No weirdness** — switching between projects (in the same window) is done correctly and does not corrupt state (unlike every existing project package I've seen)\n\n - Fully supports projects with multiple paths\n\n## Installation\n\n```\napm install project-plus\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Project Finder\n\n - `ctrl-alt-p` (linux/windows) or `ctrl-cmd-p` (mac) to open the project finder\n - `enter` will open the project in the current window\n - `shift-enter` will open the project in a new window\n\n#### Project Tab\n\n - `ctrl-cmd-tab` will switch to the next recently used project\n - `ctrl-shift-cmd-tab` will switch to the previous recently used project\n\n## Commands\n\n#### Project Plus: Open\n\nSwitch to a project (in the current atom window) by selecting one or more\nfolders using an OS folder picker.\n\n#### Project Plus: Close\n\nClose the current project and revert to an empty atom window.\n\n## Configuration\n\n#### Whitelist / Blacklist\n\nSpecify a folder or glob pattern to designate which projects will be matched.\n\n#### Show Project Path\n\nDisable to hide the project paths on the project finder.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAlways feel free to help out!
